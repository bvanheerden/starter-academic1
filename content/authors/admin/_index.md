I am a PhD student in in the UP biophysics group. My research uses
single-molecule spectroscopy to study the light harvesting complexes of
photosynthetic organisms. This includes the theory and experiment of
single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and data
analysis methods for single molecule spectroscopy.
